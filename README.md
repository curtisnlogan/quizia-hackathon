# Portfolio Hackathon README

# Quizia — JavaScript Web App

**Live Demo:** https://sourtarte.github.io/hackathon-quiz-game/  
**Tech:** JavaScript • HTML5 • CSS3 • API (Open Trivia)

A fast, responsive quiz app built in 48 hours during a team hackathon. Users can customise difficulty, category, question type, and quiz length, then play through a clean, accessible quiz game with real-time scoring.

## My biggest win
- I fixed a critical API-layer failure in the program flow that would have prevented our MVP from shipping during my first-ever hackathon. I led a major refactor of the JavaScript logic, removing dozens of bug-prone API calls and stabilizing the overall architecture. By digging into overlooked documentation that a teammate had initially skimmed past, I uncovered the root cause of the issue and guided the team toward a working solution.

## Key Highlights
- Fully-responsive minimalist UI built with Boostrap 5
- Dynamic, customisable quizzes powered by my first-ever live API integration
- Professional Git team workflow

These wireframes evolved into the final polished UI showcased above, but they gave us a solid foundation to work quickly and collaboratively.

## Project Management (Agile Board)

To keep our team organized during the hackathon, we used a **Kanban board** on GitHub Projects.
This helped us prioritize tasks, track progress, and stay aligned as a team working under tight deadlines.

**Board Columns:**

-   **To Do:** Tasks that were identified but not yet started.
-   **In Progress:** Tasks currently being developed.
-   **Done:** Completed features that were merged and tested.

**Prioritization:**

-   We used labels like _must-have_, _should-have_, and _could-have_ to prioritize tasks.
-   Critical features (e.g., Welcome Page, Accessibility) were tackled first to ensure core functionality.
-   Enhancements and nice-to-have features were added later if time allowed.

## Design Choices – Color Palette

A consistent and accessible color scheme was chosen to balance playfulness with readability.
The palette combines warm, inviting tones with strong contrasts for key actions (like answering questions or starting the quiz).

**Color Palette:**

-   **#231F20 – Raisin Black:** Used for primary text, ensuring high contrast.
-   **#BB4430 – Persian Red:** Accent color for buttons and highlights (e.g., difficulty, category).
-   **#7EBDC2 – Verdigris:** Background elements and score tracker for a calm contrast.
-   **#F3DFA2 – Vanilla:** Light, warm background for sections to improve readability.
-   **#EFE6DD – Linen:** Neutral base background to support a clean layout.

> ![Color Palette](./docs/screenshots/colour_palette.webp)

**Why these colors?**

-   Ensure **contrast** and **legibility** across devices.
-   Create a **friendly, modern look** that reflects fun and challenge.
-   Provide a clear **visual hierarchy**, where red signals importance and blue/neutral tones balance the interface.
    To complement the color palette, we selected clean and modern fonts that enhance readability and provide a friendly look for the quiz.

**Fonts Used:**

-   **Primary Font – Montserrat**
    Used for headings and key UI elements.

-   **Secondary Font – Nunito**
    Used for body text and supporting content. Nunito adds a softer, rounded feel that makes the quiz interface more approachable.

    ## Testing & Validation

To ensure the quality and reliability of Quizia, we validated both code and user experience throughout the development process.

-   **HTML Validation:**
    Checked using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
    During the first validation run, a few errors were detected (e.g., unmatched `<li>` / `</ul>` tags and multiple `selected` attributes in `<select>` elements).
    These issues were corrected, and the final version now passes validation successfully.

    > Example screenshot of initial HTML validation errors:
    > ![HTML Validation Errors](./docs/screenshots/html_erorrs.webp)

    > Screenshot after fixes (no errors):
    > ![HTML Validation Passed](./docs/screenshots/html_validation.png)

-   **CSS Validation:**
    Verified with the [W3C Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
    Stylesheets passed validation without issues.

## Reflection on AI Usage

During development, the team leveraged **AI tools** to support the coding process, streamline debugging, and optimize performance:

-   **Code Creation:** AI was used to generate the initial scaffolding for HTML. This allowed the team to dedicate more time to refining features and improving the user interface.
-   **Debugging:** AI suggested fixes for merge conflicts and identified errors in the code, significantly reducing time spent on troubleshooting.
-   **Performance Optimization:** AI provided recommendations to simplify CSS, resulting in cleaner and more efficient styling.
-   **Documentation:** AI supported the drafting of this README, helping to ensure clarity, professional structure, and consistency.

**Impact on Workflow:**
The use of AI tools accelerated the development process during the hackathon, enabling the team to deliver a polished product under time pressure. Rather than replacing creativity, AI complemented teamwork by speeding up repetitive tasks and offering quick, practical solutions.
